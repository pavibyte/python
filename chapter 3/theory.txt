CHAPTER 3 OPERATORS

DEFINITION:
   
     Symbols perform operations on values and the variables that hold those values.

ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR: =

ARITHMETIC OPERATOR: + ,-,*,/,//,%
                     /(returns the quotient values with the decimal point)
                     //(returns the quotient value without the decimal, only the whole number)
                     %(returns the remainder)
                     **(exponential)
NOTE: TO ROUND OFF THE VALUE USE THE FUNCTION round()
      "+" IS ALSO USED TO CONCATENATE TWO STRINGS.

COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR:+=,-=,/=,*=

COMPARISON OPERATOR: ==,!=,>,>=,<,<= (returns a Boolean true or false)

LOGICAL OPERATOR: and(any one value is false then false)
                   or(any one value is true then true)
                  not(opposite of the given)

TERNARY OPERATOR: print("true") if condition else print("false)
EXAMPLE:a=80
        print("right") if a>10 else print("false")
